I'm Zijian, a first-year master student studying Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan (UMich). Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree at UMich with double major in Computer Science and Pure Mathematics.

- 🔭 Research-wise, I'm mainly working on topics related to data-centric techniques, including Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Currently, I am a research assistant in the [SOCR](https://www.socr.umich.edu/index.html) group working on a clinical notes de-indentification system using NLP and deep learning techiques. Previously, I was a research assistant at [Prof. Kim's Lab](https://kim.engin.umich.edu/) working on the audio source localization.
- 🎯 I worked on the integration between Alexa and Knowledge Graph for my internship at Amazon.
- 🐾 I also like proof-based math, and I was a undergraduate researcher at the [Lab of Geometry (LoG(M))](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/research-and-career-opportunities/LoGM.html) working on Hilbert Polynomials and our work has been published [here](https://rdcu.be/cyDDg).
